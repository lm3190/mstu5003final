                <h3> Case Example #1-Tokenistic Approach</h3>
                <p> A large non-profit, providing emergency shelter to persons who are homeless is required to involve consumers on their board and to have regular on-going consumer involvement. Their funder expects that consumer’s voices will help to inform
                    and improve the way services are provided.</p>
                <p>To address their funder's requirement the shelter hands out surveys once a year. The questions are yes and no questions related to their satisfaction with the shelter. There is no other option to add any other feedback. The shelter does
                    nothing with the surveys other than collect them and does not provide survey participants any feedback after the survey. To fulfil the requirement to have a consumer on the board, the shelter staff recruit a consumer but do not involve
                    him in any discussions or provide any assistance for him to attend the board meetings.</p>

            <h3> Case Example #2-Meaningful Approach</h3>
            <p> A large non-profit food bank is interesting in getting the views of consumers on a regular basis. Their board has set a strategic goal to use consumer feedback to inform the direction of programs and policies. To do this the food bank has
                set up a consumer feedback phone line and email. All persons who provide feedback are sent a message about how their feedback will be used and taken into consideration by the board. Each person who has provided feedback is provided an
                annual report which summarizes how the board utilized the feedback they received to make changes to the organization.<br>
                <br>The food bank has also appointed five special consumer liaisons covering all the geographic areas the food bank serves. The liaisons serve as community ambassadors reporting back to the board the needs and interests of their community.
                They receive training and guidance on their roles. Their role as ambassadors is clearly communicated and they are directly involved with communicating to the board and helping to develop new programs and policies.</p>

            <h2>MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION CHECKLIST</h2></div>
        <p>What do we mean by "meaningful" participation?</p>
        <p>Meaningful participation is when a non-profit makes a concerted effort to engage with consumers in a way that is respectful of their time, interests and input. The non-profit proactivly uses the enagement of consumers to form policies, program
            and evaluate the organization.</p>
