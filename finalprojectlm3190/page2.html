                        <span class="more"> In 2012, I organized a series of community meetings on homelessness. In a small room sat twelve members of the public eager to learn and eager to share their views.<br>
A man in his late 60’s chimed in to say that he knew that “the homeless” were all “shiftless, drug abusing, users of the system” and knew that if they wanted housing it was there for them. What this gentleman did not expect was that several individuals in this small group were homeless. <br>
 A woman in her fifties turned to him and gasped. She then shared her story, one that included a high paying civilian job with the Navy, breakdown of a family, an unexpected illness and an admission of pride that prevented her from seeking the help she needed before she became homeless. Her parting words to the group and pointedly to this gentleman was “only the person wearing the shoes knows where they pinch”.
 <br> Her wisdom and this gentleman’s ignorance are key reasons why this course exists. Non-profits can only know about the needs and pain points of consumers by asking and involving them. </span>
